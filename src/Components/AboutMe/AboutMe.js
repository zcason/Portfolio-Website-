                <p>As a kid, I've always had an interest in technology, and it's the ability to drastically affect the world
                    almost instantaneously.
                    In recent years I have been exploring the latest innovations in software and rekindled my passion for
                    technology.
                    As it pertains to software development, my interests include full-stack development, blockchain, and machine
                    learning.
                    I also love working with others to achieve a common goal.</p>
                <p>My interests outside of software development are traveling, music, science, chess, and combat
                    sports(MMA, Boxing, Muy Thai, etc.).</p>
